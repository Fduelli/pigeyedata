PATCH NOTES FOR V1:
 - Fixed Error with empty sheets in the workbook, now program still runs with empty sheets.
 - Reformatted output file to sort data points by pig type instead of eye orientation(hopefully easier for any             additional data entry required).
 - Added comments to the raw java code for better readability and transparency in how the analysis is carried out
 - Added a drag and drop window for file input instead of command prompt for more user-friendly experience.
 - Template excel file added for more intuitive and correct formatting of data.
 - General tidying of source code and minor bug fixes.

V1.1 PATCH NOTES:
 - Reformatted program to account for lack of smoothed OR raw waveform values.
